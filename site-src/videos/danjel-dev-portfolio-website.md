In this video, we'll take a look at another developer portfolio and give some tips and tricks around visual hierarchy and spacing.

I talk about how to space elements to allow a user room to read, as well as how to use font sizes and line heights to give clear indication of important content on the page.

His website is [danjel.dev](danjel.dev) and you can follow along with the video and take a look at it yourself!
