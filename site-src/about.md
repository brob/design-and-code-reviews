title: About Peer Reviews
---
Bryan and James are both on a mission to help aspiring developers and designers. In that mission, they both started creating online reviews for their peers. To facilitate that better, they have joined forces and created PeerReviews.dev to better collect and distribute these reviews. These short reviews are all free of charge. All that James and Bryan ask is that they can post them as videos online so that the entire community can benefit!

Find out more about James and Bryan below with their collective 20+ years in the industry. If you're looking to get a code review or design critique (James and Bryan don't bite!) [head on over here to sign up](/sign-up/) and we'll get you added to the list!
